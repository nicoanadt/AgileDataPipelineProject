# AgileDataPipelineProject

A data pipeline in organizations is used to transform, store, and disseminate data from its data source to a data presentation layer. This project is part of my thesis to build an agile data pipeline for a dashboard. The data pipeline involved is real-time, scalable, and agile. The agile characteristic is supposed to provide flexibility and rapid development capability.

The data pipeline is composed of the following technology stack:
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Spark
- Apache Druid
- Apache Superset
